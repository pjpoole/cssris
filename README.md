# CSSris: Tetris using JQuery and CSS

[Play here](http://www.nchoosek.com/cssris/).

I wanted to do a quick project from scratch using JavaScript and CSS. At the end of a solid day's work, I had this. I'm pretty happy with how the game is working now, but I'm sure I could improve the appearance or other things.

## Keybindings

Default keybindings use the arrow keys to move (and drop); up arrow rotates clockwise.

'a' and 's' rotate counter-clockwise and clockwise, respectively.

## Todo
* Improve game palette
* Improve piece randomizer to make it less random
* Styling of game area
* Game over should pause the game briefly
* Render next piece more symmetrically

## Future features

* Customize controls
* Choose starting level
